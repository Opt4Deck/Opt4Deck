1. Overview:
   This example presents the evolutionary optimization of a cantilever beam with a variable thickness distribution under a strength
   constraint. The beam geometry is parameterized using a three-point quadratic Bezier-curve, with the control points serving as design
   variables. The objective of the procedure is to minimize the total structural mass while ensuring that the normalized bending stress
   does not exceed the material yield limit. The solution approach combines linear Euler–Bernoulli beam analysis, evolutionary search
   through the Genetic Algorithm, and penalty-based constraint handling, while supporting visualization of the optimization process for
   post-processing assessment of convergence and the resulting geometric configuration.

2. Key-features:
    - Parametric representation of the cantilever thickness distribution using a three-point quadratic Bezier-curve.
    - Structural analysis of a cantilever beam under tip loading based on Euler–Bernoulli beam theory with element-wise stress evaluation.
    - Formulation and solution of the optimization problem using a Genetic Algorithm with binary-encoded design variables.
    - Strength constraint enforcement through a penalty-based approach, based on the normalized stress ratio ∣σ∣/σy<1.
    - Normalization of design variables and objective function to ensure stable numerical behavior.
    - Dynamic visualization of the evolutionary process, enabling simultaneous monitoring of convergence and geometric evolution.

3. Usage:
    - beam.py:
      Implements the complete set of structural computations required for the analysis of a cantilever beam with variable thickness. The
      module provides the mathematical formulation of the Bezier-curve used to parameterize the thickness distribution, along with routines
      for discretizing the geometry into an element-based mesh. Based on this discretization, geometric properties and the total structural
      mass are evaluated. In addition, bending stresses are computed according to Euler–Bernoulli beam theory, enabling element-wise stress
      evaluation and normalization with respect to the material strength.
    - optimize.py:
      Defines and executes the optimization procedure. The script formulates the objective function, which is directly linked to the structural
      mass, and enforces the strength constraint through a penalty-based approach. The objective function internally invokes the structural
      analysis routines provided by beam.py, ensuring full coupling between geometry definition, structural response, and performance evaluation.
      The optimization is performed using the Genetic Algorithm with binary-encoded design variables and predefined convergence criteria. Throughout
      the optimization process, detailed generation-wise data are recorded, enabling post-processing, analysis, and visualization of the evolutionary
      search history.
    - cinema.py:
      Provides visualization of the optimization process and its corresponding results. The script processes the data generated by optimize.py
      to display the evolution of the objective function across successive generations, as well as the progressive modification of the cantilever
      geometry during the evolutionary search. In addition, it offers graphical representation of the element-wise stress distribution using a
      continuous colormap. This functionality facilitates post-processing assessment and interpretation of the final design, establishing a clear
      connection between numerical performance and structural response.
   The execution of the example is performed in two stages. First, the optimization process is initiated by running:
        python optimize.py
   which generates the required step-by-step optimization data. These data are subsequently processed by the visualization script via:
        python cinema.py
   The main optimization call within optimize.py is given by:
        opt,sol = genetic.main(Fun,Argume,Bound,Decimal,P_mut,Max_iter,Max_pop)
   where the objective function internally invokes the structural analysis routines defined in beam.py.

4. Output:
    - steps.txt: All intermediate results of the optimization process are recorded in this file, providing a concise and
                 detailed log of the GA iterations/generations for further inspection or debugging.
    - Visuality: Visualization environment for the post-processing of optimization results, capturing both the evolutionary
                 history and the final geometric solution. The upper region displays the evolution of the objective function
                 (structural mass) per generation, while the lower region presents the final cantilever geometry, the element-wise
                 stress distribution using a continuous colormap, along with the Bezier-based thickness profile and the analytical
                 reference solution.

5. Dependencies:
    - math
    - numpy
    - matplotlib
    - random
    - time
    - datetime

6. Notes:
    - Bezier-curve parameterization ensures a smooth and continuous thickness distribution while requiring a minimal number of design variables.
    - Stress values are normalized with respect to the material yield strength, both for constraint enforcement and visualization purposes.
    - Due to binary encoding of the design variables, an exhaustive search would require 2^30 evaluations; the GA provides a computationally efficient alternative.
    - The visualization script is intended solely for diagnostic and educational purposes and does not affect the optimization results.
    - The example is designed to be easily extendable to alternative loading conditions, material properties, or optimization strategies.
